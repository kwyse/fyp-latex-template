\chapter{Appendices}

\section{More relevant material}

The remaining appendices can contain relevant material which is not essential
to be included in the main body of the dissertation, but which may be useful to
support your dissertation.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Examples of relevant material might include:
  \item Example questionnaires
  \item More detailed designs
  \item Relevant results which didnâ€™t fit in the main body
\end{itemize}

Examples of material that should not go into an appendix:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A dump of all your code
  \item Transcripts of all your interviews
\end{itemize}

Remember, that the appendices should be there in case the reader wants to refer
to them.  They will not be read as part of the dissertation story, so do not
just use them to put essential material because you ran out of room.  Also, do
not be tempted to pad out your dissertation to the full 60 pages just by adding
lots of unnecessary material to the appendices.

Any supplementary materials can be uploaded electronically with your
submission.
