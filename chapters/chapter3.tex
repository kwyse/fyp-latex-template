\chapter{Approach or Methodology}

In research circles, this chapter would often be called the methodology.
Basically, it is the chapter in which you describe how you are going to go
about your project in order to achieve your Aims and Objectives.  Are you going
to gather requirements in a certain way, build some software, and measure
theresults of experiments?  Are you going to develop simulation models which
you will test with a set of expert users, or compare to existing data sets?
Will you produce a mock-up of a system and test it with a number of users to
ensure that the results are statistically significant.

Whatever you do that is relevant for your project, you need to convince your
reader that the approach you are taking will give rise to a set of results that
are unbiased, and from which you can draw objective conclusions.
