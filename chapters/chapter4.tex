\chapter{What you did Part One}

These middle chapters are the places for you to write what you have done in
more detail.  This might mean the design, implement, test elements of a
software project.   It might mean the model, evaluate re-model phases of some
kind of business modeling or simulation modeling project.  It might be the data
capture, requirements gathering, system design and mock-up test stages of an IS
project trying to evaluate the feasibility of a software system to solve a
particular problem.

You need to divide the material up amongst these middle chapters in a way that
will make sense to your reader.
