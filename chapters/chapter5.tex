\chapter{What you did Part Two}

We are following a seven chapter model, which gives you a couple of chapters in
the middle for the “What you did” part, but if you really think it is better to
have eight chapters, that is fine too.  If you go for many fewer than seven,
you have probably missed something, and if you have many more than seven, you
may be going a bit fine-grained.
