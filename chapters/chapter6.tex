\chapter{Evaluation}

This is where you will present your results and provide an evaluation of your
solution against the problem.   Try and structure your results in a meaningful
way.  Try and help the reader.  Do not just take some numbers, load them into a
statistics package such as SPSS and then present every statistical analysis
technique in the known world.  Use appropriate methods for analysing,
presenting and summarising your data.
