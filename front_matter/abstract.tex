This document is a template for the dissertation.  It includes some guidance to
help you write about your projects. You are very welcome to adjust the styles,
and change the template to suit your work.  You can have different different
headings, chapters, titles and structure.

The abstract should contain a high level description of the project.  You
should cover:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Overview of the Problem
  \item Approach
  \item Summary of the contribution and outcomes
\end{itemize}

Try to keep the abstract short, and certainly not more than about 300 words.
